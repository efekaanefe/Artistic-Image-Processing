# Artistic-Image-Processing

Main purpose of this repo is to take an image input, apply some math on it, and output a new image which looks somehow artistic.

- [ ] **Gaussian Splatting**: Adds soft blur effects, creating a smoother artistic look.
- [ ] **Edge Detection (Sobel, Canny)**: Highlights contours and lines in the image.
- [ ] **Pencil Sketch Effect**: Converts images into pencil or chalk-like monochromatic renderings.
- [ ] **Watercolor Simulation**: Applies bilateral filtering and edge detection for watercolor aesthetics.
- [ ] **Median Filtering**: Smooths details while maintaining sharp edges for an abstract look.
- [ ] **Bilateral Filter**: Smooths regions while preserving edges, creating an abstract feel.
- [ ] **Halftone Effect**: Produces a retro, dot-based print simulation.
- [ ] **Voronoi Diagram**: Creates a mosaic effect with randomized cells and colors.
- [ ] **Fourier Transform Manipulation**: Alters frequency components for unique visual effects.
- [ ] **Quadtree Decomposition**: Applies blocky, pixelated effects by subdividing the image.
- [ ] **Pointillism Effect**: Mimics pointillist painting with color-based dithering.
